## History & Vision
"This tool was created as part of the ongoing efforts of Nokib Sarkar, the lead developer behind the Wiki Loves Folklore project‚Äîone of the most prominent photography campaigns within the Wikimedia Movement. During past editions of the competition, it became evident to the organizing team and jury that existing tools lacked a community-centric approach and failed to fully empower volunteers in the image selection process on Wikimedia Commons.

Driven by this need, the development of this tool began‚Äîguided by feedback from Wikimedia Commons volunteers, jury members, and years of experience from organizing Wiki Loves Folklore. The inspiration for this project was significantly shaped by the success of the previous Feminism and Folklore article jury tool, known as Campwiz, which received the Coolest Tool Award at Wikimania Poland.

Powered by Wikimedia Switzerland, the vision to build a jury tool designed for the community, by the community took shape. Initial development was supported by the servers of Wiki Loves Folklore, a community initiative endorsed by the Wikimedia Foundation. The project gained further momentum during Wikimania, where the development roadmap and vision were collaboratively sketched by community members.

After months of dedicated research, coding, and testing, the tool is now live‚Äîdebuting with the jury process for the seventh edition of Wiki Loves Folklore. This marks a proud milestone, as we host our very first campaign using infrastructure built specifically for Wikimedia campaigns.

Built with Golang‚Äîa language the developer learned specifically for this project‚Äîthis tool represents a labor of love, technical curiosity, and deep commitment to the Wikimedia community. We look forward to migrating it to Wikimedia Cloud servers soon, ensuring greater accessibility and sustainability.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to:
- **Wikimedia Switzerland** and the **Wikimedia Foundation** for their generous support,
- **Wiki Loves Folklore** for the initial support hosting the tool and resources to experiment the software engineering needs
> ***Personal Note From the Developer:*** Wiki Loves Folklore always supported all kind of technical advancement toward the community including amazing tools like FnF List Generator, CampWiz, CampWiz nxt (this tool). They were always open to experimentation and technical vision. Sometimes, mistakes by me happened, which incurred some resources being wasted or under-utilized. But they gave me the freedom to work on the research and development without any dragging by behind. I am very very grateful to them.
> <br/> &mdash; Nokib Sarkar, Lead Developer

- Our fellow volunteers for their help in translation, documentation, testing,
- And the jury members who placed their trust in this tool.

#WeTogether, have built something that empowers the community and strengthens our collective mission. This is just the beginning."
